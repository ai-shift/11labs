Researchers find large language models process diverse types of data, like different languages, audio inputs, images, etc., similarly to how humans reason about complex problems. Humanity can farm more food from the seas to help feed the planet while shrinking mariculture's negative impacts on biodiversity, according to new research. Scientists across Africa, America, Asia, Australia, and Europe outline for the first time how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can transform the landscape of infectious disease research and improve pandemic preparedness. The potential applications are vast, both in basic research and in improving existing medical treatments, such as those for skin cancer. New research shows neonatal HSV infections may lead to long-term cognitive impairment

In the next few years, Musumeci predicted, “I see democratized AI creating new business models where the gap between big and small players closes entirely, giving more entrepreneurs the confidence and capability to thrive.” Speaking of education, Forrest Zeisler, co-founder and chief technology officer at Jobber, suggested that ubiquitous, cheap AI may even make “the need to attend business school and earn an MBA obsolete.” “As AI becomes cheap, accessible, and capable of human-like reasoning, we’re on the verge of hyper-personalized experiences that were previously impossible," said Vincent Koc, lecturer at University of New South Wales. Personalized AI-driven is more than chatbots; “it’s about creating an AI-driven personal doctor that clinicians can augment rather than replace,” Koc predicted.

"We have built a cloud company for this AI-first world — combining state-of-the-art open source models and high performance infrastructure, with frontier research in AI efficiency and scalability," Together AI CEO Vipul Ved Prakash said in the company's announcement. The rise of open-source models like DeepSeek represents a significant shift in the AI landscape — its emergence has pushed companies to rethink traditional approaches to AI deployment, particularly around computational efficiency and infrastructure requirements. The company's $3.3 billion valuation and substantial GPU deployment plans reflect a broader industry trend — despite the growth of efficient open-source models, the demand for AI computing infrastructure appears to be increasing.

“Small language models allow us to train AI on domain-specific knowledge, making them far more effective for real-world business needs.” Another reason why we’re now seeing a greater demand for SLMs, according to Baum, is that there are several privacy and security concerns linked to LLMs. Many enterprises hesitate to use cloud-based generative AI tools because of concerns about data leakage and compliance risks. The conversation around small language models inevitably leans into the broader discussion on agentic AI — a new wave of so-called AI agents that, unlike traditional AI systems, operate autonomously, making real-time decisions based on incoming data. For many business leaders, the question isn’t about which AI model people are jumping on, but about “which model drives real business value for our company?”

AI image generation—revolution, accessibility, and the growing pains | Business Insider Africa From photorealistic portraits spun out of a single prompt to whimsical depictions of imaginary landscapes, AI image generation tools are reshaping how digital images come into being. This freedom spurred the creation of new tools, interfaces, and add-ons that turned Stable Diffusion into a sort of “Swiss Army knife” for AI image generation. This underscores a major challenge for any AI image platform: how do you create truly effective guardrails when the underlying technology is so powerful and adaptable? We bring you daily editor picks from the best Business Insider news content so you can stay updated on the latest topics and conversations on the African market, leaders, careers and lifestyle.

X’s new AI tools can automate ad creation and performance analysis. X is debuting AI-powered advertising tools designed to automate ad creation and performance analysis, the company announced Friday. Two new features, rolling out in phases to advertisers, rely on X’s proprietary AI assistant Grok to generate ad copy, imagery, and campaign insights with minimal human input. Though some advertisers are making their way back to the platform, X’s ad revenue has yet to fully recover. IPG, whose planned merger with Omnicom will establish the largest advertising holdco in the world, has signed a new annual deal with X for potential ad spending, according to a report Wednesday from The Wall Street Journal.

The news may come as a surprise to some who expected the rise of China's DeepSeek AI model, which made waves last month with high-profile claims of more efficient model design and free-to-use tiers, to disrupt the growth of more established companies working on generative AI. The COO said that enterprise growth is being helped by usage from non-business customers, and that OpenAI expects that many companies will come to rely on AI services the way they do cloud computing. "With users now knowing that small AI is already here, they are confident that OpenAI will start to reduce prices (and they did), they will focus on smaller AI, and they will open themselves up as DeepSeek is open source."

XAI Has New Data Center With 12,000 GPUs and $700 Million in Hardware - Business Insider Elon Musk's new Atlanta data center for xAI has $700 million in AI equipment and 12,000 GPUs xAI plans to operate a large data center to support X in Atlanta. Elon Musk's AI startup plans to operate a large data center with X. X representatives described it as an "exascale" data center capable of computing "trillion-parameter AI." But the Georgia facility pales in comparison to the reported capacity of xAI's Memphis project, nicknamed Colossus, which Musk has called the largest data center in the world. According to the records, X contributed 90% of the hardware for the data center, and xAI 10%.

Microsoft's Magma AI Can Manipulate and Control Robots - CNET Home All Home Home Microsoft's Magma AI Can Manipulate and Control Robots The AI model was designed to help robots navigate and more intuitively interact with the world around them. Microsoft's Magma AI controls a robot arm, directing it to pick up a mushroom and put it in the cooking pot. Microsoft just introduced Magma, a new AI model designed to help robots see, understand and act more intelligently. Unlike traditional artificial intelligence models, Magma processes different types of data all at once – an effort Microsoft is calling a big leap toward "agentic AI," or systems that can plan and execute tasks on a user's behalf.

J. Cole's New Song 'Clouds' Warns About AI Fears Billboard Billboard Music Awards J. Cole Expresses His Fears About AI in New Song ‘Clouds’ J. Cole is back with his first new song of 2025, and used the track to express some fears about AI. “Don’t buy, subscribe so you can just stream your content/ Like rent, you won’t own a thing/ Before long, all the songs the whole world sings’ll be generated by latest of AI regimes/ As all of our favorite artists erased by it scream/ From the wayside, ‘Aye, whatever happened to human beings?’” Cole spits. The North Carolina rapper didn’t clarify much in his blog post about “Clouds,” but did detail his motivation behind dropping new music.

AI chatbots unable to accurately summarise news, BBC study finds | The Star AI's distortion of reporting on real-world events could undermine people's already fragile faith in facts and verified information, say the authors of a study on AI's answers about news stories. Deborah Turness said the BBC was hoping to “open up a new conversation with AI tech providers” on the issue, with the aim of finding solutions to so-called distortions in AI chatbot responses. The BBC News chief executive said AI’s “extraordinary benefits” must not be outweighed by the creation of a “world where people searching for answers are served distorted, defective content that presents itself as fact”.
